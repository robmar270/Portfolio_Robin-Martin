# Monthly Reviews Project

## Description
During my last internship at a SaaS B2B company, we needed to send monthly updates to our clients. To address this requirement, I developed a solution that segments our customer base and automates the distribution of personalized emails.

This Python script leverages the Google Sheets API to retrieve company data from a spreadsheet. It performs basic data manipulations to tailor the information for each segment and then dynamically inserts this data into an HTML template based on the `company_id`. 
The emails are sent using a configured application that requires app-specific credentials, which I obtained by registering the application with Google. The script concludes by logging and displaying the email addresses to which the updates were successfully sent.

### Key Features:
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches company data from Google Sheets.
- **Data Manipulation**: Processes and segments data for personalized communication.
- **Dynamic Email Content**: Integrates processed data into HTML templates.
- **Email Automation**: Sends out personalized emails through a secured application.
- **Logging**: Tracks and displays the recipients of each email.
